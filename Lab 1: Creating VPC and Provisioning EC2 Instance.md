## Overview
In this lab, you will learn how to launch an EC2 instance within the public subnet of a default VPC and connect to it. Whether you're using Linux, macOS, or Windows, the guide provides tailored instructions, including using PuTTY for Windows users.

## 0. Create VPC

1. Go to AWS VPC in the management Console.

2. Note that 5 vpcs are allowed per region. You can use sydney, singapore, north virginia, ohio and tokyo.
  
3.  Click on Create VPC >  VPC and more

4. Turn off the NAT Gateway and S3 Gateway

5. Click Create  


## 1. Launch an EC2 Instance

1-a. Open the **EC2 Dashboard**, navigate to **Instances**, and click **Launch Instance**.

- Create a **new security group**, which you can rename. Enable the option to a**llow SSH traffic from anywhere** (port 22 open to 0.0.0.0/0), providing global SSH access (not recommended for production environments).

>Please note that this is not the best practice, we are only doing this for demonstration purposes.

![](https://sb-next-prod-image-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/public/CAMP/Labs2025/Session1/Lab1/image-14.png)

- If an **error** occurs regarding permissions, **proceed to the next step**.

2-d. Adjust the key permissions by running:

`chmod 400 <key-pair-name>`
